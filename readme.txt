== Installation ==

**Most common issues are solved by reading the <a href="https://www.auctionnudge.com/wordpress-plugin/usage">Help section</a>. Bugs and errors can be reported <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/auction-nudge/">here</a>. Please do this before leaving a poor review.**

Once the plugin has been activated, go to Settings > Auction Nudge to set your default eBay username and eBay site. These aren't required, but this will save you time.

Now you can add the appropriate Auction Nudge Shortcode to your WordPress site anywhere Shortcodes are supported:

`<!-- To display Your eBay Listings -->
[auction-nudge tool="listings"]

Use the Shortcode Generator (Settings > Auction Nudge) to customise your content, or pass your options to the Shortcode like this:

`<!-- Showing items for the eBay username "ebay_username" -->
[auction-nudge tool="listings" sellerid="ebay_username"]

<!-- Show 100 items, in French and disable search -->
[auction-nudge tool="listings" lang="french" maxentries="100" search_box="0"]`

= Nothing Displaying? =

A common reason for Auction Nudge not loading is the use of **ad blocking browser plugins**. If you are using such a plugin, disable it, or add an exception to see if Auction Nudge loads without it.

= How Often Does Auction Nudge Update? =

To reduce server load, Auction Nudge does not update every time it is loaded on your site. The Your eBay Listings tool updates every 15 minutes.

= How Is Such an Awesome Tool Free? =

Auction Nudge funds itself through referral commissions from eBay. As a member of the eBay Partner Network, Auction Nudge may receive anonymous referral commissions from eBay if a successful transaction occurs after clicking a link to eBay, at no cost to the user.

This means Auction Nudge is free to use and there are no 'pay to unlock' restrictions.

= How Can I Modify the Appearance of Auction Nudge? =

Please see the <a href="https://www.auctionnudge.com/wordpress-plugin/usage">Using the Plugin</a> page of the Auction Nudge website.

= Where Can I Find More Help? =

The following links should help with most questions and issues:
	
* The <a href="https://www.auctionnudge.com/wordpress-plugin/usage">WordPress Help</a> page.
* The <a href="https://www.auctionnudge.com/help">Full Auction Nudge Help</a> section.
* The <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/auction-nudge/">Plugin Support</a> forum on WordPress.org.

= Can I Remove The Advertising Disclosure? =

No. The [advertising disclosure](https://www.auctionnudge.com/about#disclosure) is a requirement of the [eBay Partner Network](https://partnernetwork.ebay.com/page/network-agreement#guidelines) and is a condition of use for Auction Nudge.

This means that if you are not happy with the Advertising Disclosure, then Auction Nudge is not the **free tool** for you.

Attempting to hide, obscure or modifying the disclosure puts the service at risk for all users. Therefore, Auction Nudge reserves the right to block any user who attempts to do so.

= What happened to the Your eBay Profile and Your eBay Feedback tools? =

These tools are being retired as of October 2024. Unfortunately, eBay has scheduled the data source for these tools to be decommissioned in February 2025. With no alternative available, it will no longer be possible to provide these tools.

The tools will continue to function as normal until the Shopping API is decommissioned, when the tools will cease to function and no content will be displayed on the page.

The Your eBay Listings tool has already been migrated to the new Browse API and will continue to be supported :)

When this option is enabled, a list of categories is displayed above your items (if you have items in more than one category). This allows users to filter your items by simply selecting a category from the list.
* **Listing Type Filter** – Filter items by listing type filter, making it possible to just display Auction or Buy It Now items.

**Updated**

* **<a href="https://www.auctionnudge.com/help/options#keyword-filter">Keyword Filter</a>** – The "keyword" filter for the Your eBay Listings tool has been rewritten to allow for additional search operators, making this feature much more powerful.
